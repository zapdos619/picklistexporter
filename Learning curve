1. planning how a website is build of how many section might come how that part is build.
2. divide the things that we need to create that particular section.
3. first do section 4. then its internal div upon content separaization

so currnetly this does a single task whihc is getting picklist values and there apis this the main taks for now. but for now i want to expand this project. to other things liek adding dependency analysis, metatadta exporter and other formula fields extractor and so on in futre.
the ui will follow in this step
login(same as now and also keep other core funtinality)-->a big ui containting everthing button and object selector section like right now selecet deselect option and must show all the objects liek right now-->and after the selection of object user presees any of the buttons showed below the selection-deselection panel like the tasks i would like to add in future those option for now just keep the current fuction button--> the logout button should be in the uppoer right corener liek the place it is currently at-->the below terminal that is showing the progress should be a bit big currently it is a bit small from both side and in hight so make it a bit bigger.
